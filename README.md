## **Student at University of Missouri-Columbia | Educator at lululemon | Economics Major**

I am a senior at the University of Missouri studying Economics, Business, and Textile and Apparel Management. I have worked in retail, most recently at lululemon, developing my leadership, collaboration, communication, and tactical skills pertaining to retail operations. I have also worked in an office setting at both the Department of Economics within the University and for a financial advisor. These experiences have helped cultivate skills such as working with excel, organization, and client communications. I am currently exploring many career paths and am open to opportunities in a variety of fields.
